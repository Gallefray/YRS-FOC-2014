<h1>Goverment Debt</h1>
<p>This project is aimed to help young people understanding the amount of debt the goverment digs itself into evry year and how it is difficult<br> to stay out of debt. A quick guide to this game, you have four options on how much to spend on each department the more you spend the more chance<br> you have of going into debt, and the main objective is to stay out of debt.</p>
