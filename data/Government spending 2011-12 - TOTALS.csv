UK SPENDING 2011-12,,,,,,,
"Public spending by the UK's central government departments, 2011-2012. The figures give a picture of major expenditure but exclude local government spending not controlled by central government. We don't have room to show everything — some programmes are just too small to go here, but this gives a flavour of where your tax pounds go. It also excludes government departments who are predominantly financed by their income, such as the Crown Estate or the Export Credits Guarantee Department",,,,,,,
